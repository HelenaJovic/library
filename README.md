# Library Managment System

## Overview

This project involves the development of a web-based library system, designed to manage and facilitate library operations efficiently. The system offers a user-friendly interface for both library staff and patrons, enabling easy access to book information, member management, and other library services. This comprehensive project integrates a robust backend developed with Node.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL, and a sleek frontend designed with React and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Components

1. **Backend Development:**

Utilized Node.js and Express to create a scalable and efficient backend structure.
Integrated Prisma as an ORM tool to interact seamlessly with a PostgreSQL database, ensuring smooth data handling and manipulation.
Designed RESTful API endpoints to handle various library operations such as book lookups, member registrations, and transaction processing.

2.**Frontend Development:**

Developed a responsive and interactive user interface using React, offering a seamless user experience.
Employed Tailwind CSS to style the application, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive layout.
Implemented dynamic data rendering and state management to provide real-time feedback and interactions to users.

3. **Database Design and Management:**

Designed a relational database schema using PostgreSQL, optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Implemented comprehensive data models to represent books, members, loans, and other library entities.
Ensured data integrity and consistency through well-defined relationships and constraints.

## Getting Started

1. **Setting Up the Environment:**
   Install the required Node.js packages, set up the PostgreSQL database, and configure the Prisma ORM.

2. **Running the Application:**
   Start the backend server with **npm start** and launch the frontend application. Ensure both systems are connected and communicating effectively.

3. **Interacting with the System:**
   Use the web interface to explore various functionalities, from browsing the book catalog to managing member accounts.

Your contributions, feedback, or issue reports are highly valued to enhance the functionality and usability of the Library System Web Application.
